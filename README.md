# Credit_Prediction
This is a project that uses Python and Machine Learning Algorithms to predict if a bank client is eligible for credit.

Open the .ipynb file (Notebook) to access the Python code and set the path for the csv file!
Then you only need to run the cells to create the ML Model.

Hope that you like it.
