# Credit_Prediction
This is a project that uses Python and Machine Learning Algorithms to predict if a bank client is eligible for credit.
I have compared Decision Tree, KNN, Naive Bayes and Logistic Regression models to test which fits better im this problem.

Open the .ipynb file (Notebook) to access the Python code and set the path for the csv file!
Then you only need to run the cells to create the ML Model.

Im only a student in the process of learning. If you have any suggestions, improvements or advices, please do not hesitate to comment and help me out!
